\section{Introduction}
% motivation for creating this theme
\begin{frame}{Introduction}{}
\begin{block}{Why the AAU Simple beamer theme?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> During the last couple of years, I have shared the beamer themes named \chref{http://kom.aau.dk/~jkn/latex/latex.php\#beamer_aausidebar}{AAU Sidebar} and \chref{http://kom.aau.dk/~jkn/latex/latex.php\#beamer_aalborg}{Aalborg} on my website \chref{http://kom.aau.dk/~jkn}{http://kom.aau.dk/\textasciitilde jkn}.
    \item<2-> Both of these themes feature a sidebar in which the table of content and progress are shown.
    \item<3-> Some people (in particular one - Yes, I am looking at you, Mads) have been asking about an AAU beamer theme without a sidebar. The present theme named \alert{AAU Simple} is precisely that. 
    \item<4-> Like the \chref{http://kom.aau.dk/~jkn/latex/latex.php\#beamer_aausidebar}{AAU Sidebar} theme, the theme is not really useful to people not affiliated with AAU due to the tight integration between the theme and the round AAU logo. However, everyone is of course encouraged to download and modify the theme according to their own needs. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\subsection{Prepayment}
\begin{frame}{Prepayment}{South African Example}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Why prepayment?
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Poor households
  		\item Informal accommodation
  	\end{itemize}
    \item Parties
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Eskom - state owned
    	\item Local electricity distributors
    	\item Token vending agents
    	\item Customers vendors
    	\item Equipment vendors
    \end{itemize}
    \item Issues
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Brownout
    	\item Token vending machines
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Security Economics}
\begin{frame}{Security Economics}{South African Example}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Going from credit to prepayment resulted in 10\% reduced energy usage
		\item Same in Northern Ireland, Russia and Brazil
		\item People care more about their usage because they have to go to the vending station and use their ATM card or cash
		\item Easy debt management - no court order, no replacement of meter 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Smart Meter Fraud}
\begin{frame}{Smart Meter Fraud}{General}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Vulnerabilities will get industrialised
		\item The South African example shows this 
		\item Fixing a bug is very expensive
		\item Replacing 100 million meters in Europe would take 5 years and cost \$20bn
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Privacy}
\begin{frame}{Smart Meter Data}{The problem}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Smart meter data in Europe is recorded in fine granularity
		\item Extract personal information by analysing the meter data
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How many live in the house?
			\item When are they asleep?
			\item Are they home at the moment?
		\end{itemize}
		\item Home appliance vendors, burglars etc.
		\item Customer vs energy company owned data
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Smart Meter Data}{Who owns it?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Most countries move toward customer owned data
		\item The tussle is the granularity one should share
		\item Energy company: 48 readings per 24h
		\item Customer: Only enough for billing
		\item European Convention on Human Rights: European citizens have the right to respect for the privacy	of their family life.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Strategic Vulnerabilities}
\begin{frame}{Centralised Metering System}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Avoid rolling out a truck to the customer
	\item When countries are in conflict - energy is a target
	\item Remote computer exploits, vulnerabilities:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Software upgrade
		\item Tariff setting
		\item Billing
		\item API attacks
		\item Applets
	\end{itemize}
	\item General problem: Replacing hardware is expensive
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Overregulation}

	\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Conflict of Interest}
\begin{frame}{Company vs Government}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Companies buy energy which varies by time of day
		\item Ikke interessant??!?!
