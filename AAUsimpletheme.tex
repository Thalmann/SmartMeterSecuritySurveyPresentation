\begin{frame}{Introduction}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Overview
		
		\hfil
		\item Context
		
		\hfil
		\item Examples
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Prepayment}
\subsection{Prepayment}
\begin{frame}{Prepayment}{South African Example}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Why prepayment?
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Poor households
  		\item Informal accommodation
  	\end{itemize}
    \item Parties
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Eskom - state owned
    	\item Local electricity distributors
    	\item Token vending agents
    	\item Customers vendors
    	\item Equipment vendors
    \end{itemize}
    \item Issues
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Brownout
    	\item Token vending machines
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Security Economics}
\begin{frame}{Security Economics}{South African Example}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Going from credit to prepayment resulted in 10\% reduced energy usage
		\item Same in Northern Ireland, Russia and Brazil
		\item People care more about their usage because they have to go to the vending station and use their ATM card or cash
		\item Easy debt management - no court order, no replacement of meter 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Smart Meter Fraud}
\begin{frame}{Smart Meter Fraud}{General}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Vulnerabilities will get industrialised
		\item The South African example shows this 
		\item Fixing a bug is very expensive
		\item Replacing 100 million meters in Europe would take 5 years and cost \$20bn
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Privacy}
\begin{frame}{Smart Meter Data}{The problem}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Smart meter data in Europe is recorded in fine granularity
		\item Extract personal information by analysing the meter data
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How many live in the house?
			\item When are they asleep?
			\item Are they home at the moment?
		\end{itemize}
		\item Home appliance vendors, burglars etc.
		\item Customer vs energy company owned data
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Smart Meter Data}{Who owns it?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Most countries move toward customer owned data
		\item The tussle is the granularity one should share
		\item Energy company: 48 readings per 24h
		\item Customer: Only enough for billing
		\item European Convention on Human Rights: European citizens have the right to respect for the privacy	of their family life.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Strategic Vulnerabilities}
\begin{frame}{Centralised Metering System}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Avoid rolling out a truck to the customer
	\item When countries are in conflict - energy is a target
	\item Remote computer exploits, vulnerabilities:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Software upgrade
		\item Tariff setting
		\item Billing
		\item API attacks
		\item Applets
	\end{itemize}
	\item General problem: Replacing hardware is expensive
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Overregulation}
\begin{frame}{Overregulation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Concerns about over regulating the smart meter security
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{hi}
\subsection{Conflict of Interest}
\begin{frame}{Company vs Government}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Companies buy energy which varies by time of day
		\item Ikke interessant??!?!
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Differences in Europe}
\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Germany - a customer can choose an energy company
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Company sets up smart meter
			\item Disliked because fewer smart meters were sold
		\end{itemize}
		\item United Kingdom - centralised system by a Data Communication Company
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Same smart meter
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
